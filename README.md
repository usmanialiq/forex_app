## Welcome to Forex App

This app uses an API from [Fixer.io](https://fixer.io), fetching the currency exchange rates of the countries.

Although it is not working because the API I have included does not come with a SSL Encryption, this unencryption is not supported by the environments like [Github](https://github.com) or [Netlify](https:netlify.com).

You can find a working model at [Forex_App](forex-api.surge.sh).
### Markdown

You can commit changes to your app by changing few details in the javascript file,

```markdown
->js/main.js

change the value of the const **API_KEY**

if you want to change the date of the exchange rate, change the const **set_date** as **YYYY-MM-DD**


### Scope

Developers can integrate this repo and scale their version into a much bigger applications by implementing a **Search System**, **Date Picker**, **Currency Converter**. 

Do read the documentation and features of this API at [Fixer.io](https://fixer.io).
